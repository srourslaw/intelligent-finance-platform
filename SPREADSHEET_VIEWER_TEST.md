## 🧹 Cleanup Instructions

If this test doesn't meet expectations, here's how to remove it completely:

```bash
rm frontend/src/pages/SpreadsheetViewer.tsx
rm SPREADSHEET_VIEWER_TEST.md
```

### 2. Remove Dependencies

cd frontend
npm uninstall xlsx handsontable
```

### 3. Remove Route from App.tsx
Remove these lines from `frontend/src/App.tsx`:

- Route: The entire `<Route path="/spreadsheet-viewer".../>` block

### 4. Commit Cleanup
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: Remove spreadsheet viewer test"
git push
```

## 💡 Integration Plan (If Successful)

   - View budget files directly
   - Compare versions side-by-side

3. **Financial Builder Integration**
   - Preview extracted Excel data
   - Show before/after processing
   - Validate data extraction

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Cell editing (if needed)
   - Export to different formats
   - Print-friendly view
   - Share spreadsheet views

## 📝 Evaluation Criteria

- Accurate display
- Good UX
- No major bugs
- Easy to integrate

### ❌ Failure = Remove It
- Slow (> 5 sec load)
