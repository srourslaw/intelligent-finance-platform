# Checkpoint: October 11, 2025 - AI Animation Fluid Controls & Project Selector

## Quick Resume Instructions
To continue from this checkpoint:
1. Pull latest from GitHub: `git pull origin main`
2. Navigate to frontend: `cd intelligent-finance-platform/frontend`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (if needed)
4. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
5. Start backend: `cd ../backend && python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
6. Open browser: http://localhost:5173

## What Works Right Now

- ✅ AI Data Mapping Animation with fluid speed controls
- ✅ Start/Pause/Reset buttons all working correctly
- ✅ Speed toggle: Slow (800ms) → Normal (400ms) → Fast (200ms) → Ultra (100ms)
- ✅ Speed changes take effect immediately during animation
- ✅ Project selector dropdown under "File Processing"
- ✅ Dynamic project switching with automatic file structure reload
- ✅ Animation auto-resets when changing projects
- ✅ Real project files loaded from backend API
- ✅ 144 files displayed from project-a-123-sunset-blvd
- ✅ Scrollable file sidebar with connection lines
- ✅ Backend API endpoint `/api/projects/{project_id}/file-structure`

## What's In Progress

- N/A - All features complete and working

## What's Next (Priority Order)

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile animation with large projects (1000+ files)
   - Consider virtualization for very large file lists
   - Optimize particle rendering at Ultra speed

2. **UX Enhancements**
   - Add loading indicator when fetching project structure
   - Add "No projects found" message for empty project list
   - Consider project thumbnail/preview in dropdown

3. **Animation Features**
   - Add ability to skip to specific file in animation
   - Add progress slider to scrub through animation timeline
   - Consider adding "Loop" option to restart automatically
   - Add pause-on-hover for file inspection

## Critical Notes

### Animation Architecture
- **Pure async/await pattern**: NO setTimeout scheduling for particles
- **Speed control**: Only uses `await sleep(speedRef.current / N)` for timing
- **State sync**: `useEffect` automatically syncs `speedRef.current` with `speed` state
- **Particles**: Created immediately in animation loop, not scheduled

### Speed Values (Proportional 2x)
- Slow: 800ms (baseline)
- Normal: 400ms (2x faster)
- Fast: 200ms (4x faster)
- Ultra: 100ms (8x faster)

### Known Issues
- Speed toggle responsive but user reports occasional glitchiness (needs further investigation)
- Consider adding debounce to speed toggle if users spam it rapidly

### Dependencies
- Backend must be running on `localhost:8000`
- Frontend connects to backend for project file structures
- Uses axios for HTTP requests

## File Locations (Quick Reference)

- Animation component: `frontend/src/components/dashboard/AIDataMappingAnimation.tsx`
- Projects page: `frontend/src/pages/Projects.tsx`
- Backend API: `backend/app/routers/project_files.py`
- Development log: `wiki/03_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`

## Debug Notes

- Animation uses `speedRef` (ref) instead of `speed` (state) in loops for immediate effect
- `useEffect` with `[speed]` dependency keeps ref in sync with state
- Project selector triggers `useEffect` with `[selectedProjectId]` dependency
- `resetAll()` clears `activeNodesRef` Set to deactivate all nodes
- Backend requires `backend/projects/[project-id]/data/` directory structure

## Testing Checklist

When resuming:
- [ ] Verify dev server starts without errors
- [ ] Test Start button - animation begins
- [ ] Test Pause button - animation pauses
- [ ] Test Resume - animation continues from pause
- [ ] Test Reset - animation clears completely
- [ ] Test Speed toggle - cycles through all 4 speeds
- [ ] Test Speed change during animation - takes effect immediately
- [ ] Test Project dropdown - lists all projects
- [ ] Test Project selection - loads new file structure
- [ ] Check console for any errors/warnings

## Session Statistics

## Architecture Diagrams

### Speed Control Flow
```
User clicks speed toggle
  ↓
setSpeed(newSpeed)
  ↓
useEffect detects speed change
  ↓
speedRef.current = speed
  ↓
Next await sleep(speedRef.current / N) uses new speed
```

### Project Selection Flow
```
User selects project from dropdown
  ↓
onProjectChange(projectId)
  ↓
setSelectedProjectId(projectId)
  ↓
useEffect detects selectedProjectId change
  ↓
fetchProjectStructure(projectId)
  ↓
Backend returns file structure
  ↓
setProjectStructure(newStructure)
  ↓
Animation component re-renders with new files
```

### Animation Loop (Simplified)
```
Start button clicked
  ↓
For each file:
  - activateNode(file)
  - Create particles immediately
  - await sleep(speedRef.current / 6)
  - activateNode(next layer)
  - Create more particles
  - await sleep(speedRef.current / 6)
  - Continue through layers...
  - await sleep(speedRef.current / 3)
  - deactivateNode(all)
  - await sleep(speedRef.current / 8)
```
