### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None yet (frontend dependencies will be added next)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Documentation-First Approach**:
   - Decision: Create comprehensive documentation before coding
   - Why: Ensures clear vision and reduces rework
   - Alternative considered: Start coding immediately and document later

2. **Session Management Workflow**:
   - Decision: Use three separate workflow files (Start, Checkpoint, Resume)
   - Why: Provides clear, focused instructions for each phase
   - Master file (00_CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md) ties everything together

3. **Wiki-Based Documentation**:
   - Decision: Use markdown files in wiki/ directory
   - Why: Easy to version control, searchable, and developer-friendly
   - Alternative considered: External documentation (Notion, Confluence)

4. **GitHub as Single Source of Truth**:
   - Decision: Rely on Git commits and documentation for context
   - Why: Enables seamless resumption across sessions and AI context windows
   - Critical for long-term project memory

### Challenges Encountered

  - Feature cards highlighting key capabilities
  - Call-to-action button to view dashboard
  - Links to GitHub and Vercel
- ✅ Set up React Router for navigation:
  - Updated `App.tsx` with BrowserRouter
  - Routes: `/` (Home) and `/dashboard` (Dashboard)
  - Seamless client-side routing

### Current Project State
- **What's working**:
  - Complete React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
  - React Router navigation between Home and Dashboard
  - KPICard component fully functional and reusable
  - Dashboard displaying realistic project financial data
  - Responsive design works on all screen sizes
  - Alert system for over-budget and behind-schedule projects
  - Dev server runs without errors

- **What's in progress**:
  - N/A (Phase 1 complete)

- **What's tested**:
  - Dashboard page with all 6 KPI cards
  - Navigation between Home and Dashboard
  - Responsive layout on different screen sizes
  - Color-coded alerts for negative metrics
  - Progress bar functionality

- **What needs testing**:
  - Multiple project data (currently hardcoded for Project A)
  - Chart components (Phase 2)

### Code Changes Summary
- **Files created**:
  - `src/components/dashboard/KPICard.tsx` - Reusable KPI card component with trend indicators
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Executive dashboard with 6 KPI cards and financial summary
  - `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Landing page with navigation to dashboard

- **Files modified**:
  - `src/App.tsx` - Added React Router with routes for Home and Dashboard

- **Directories created**:
  - `src/components/dashboard/` - Dashboard-specific components
  - `src/pages/` - Page-level components

### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None (React Router was already installed in Phase 0)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Decision: Create reusable KPICard component instead of inline cards
   - Why: Promotes code reuse, easier to maintain, consistent UI
   - Alternative considered: Hardcoding each card separately

2. **Color-Coded Alerts**:
   - Decision: Use red for negative metrics (over budget, behind schedule)
   - Why: Immediate visual feedback for problem areas
   - Implementation: Trend prop ('positive', 'negative', 'neutral') controls colors

3. **Realistic Demo Data**:
   - Decision: Hardcode Project A data directly in Dashboard component
   - Why: Simple for Phase 1 demo, will refactor to JSON/API in Phase 3
   - Data shows realistic over-budget scenario (-$8,500 loss, 12 days behind)

4. **Alert Banner**:
   - Decision: Show prominent alert banner when project has issues
   - Why: Ensures critical information is immediately visible
   - Alternative considered: Just using red colors on cards (less noticeable)

5. **Client-Side Routing**:
   - Decision: Use React Router for SPA navigation
   - Why: Better UX, faster page transitions, maintains state
   - Alternative considered: Traditional multi-page app (worse UX)

### Challenges Encountered
- None - Phase 1 development went smoothly

### Next Session Goals
1. **Phase 2: Data Visualization**
   - Add revenue vs. expenses line chart (time series)
   - Add budget vs. actual bar chart (by category)
   - Add expense category breakdown pie chart
   - Implement date range filters
   - Make charts interactive with tooltips

2. **Phase 3 Preparation**:
   - Create JSON files with realistic financial data
   - Design data structure for transactions, budgets, invoices

### Technical Decisions Made

#### 1. PDF Format Only (No Excel/JSON)
- **Decision**: Generate actual PDF files only
- **Rationale**: User specified "PDF FORMAT ONLY - no JSON files" to match real-world construction document reality
- **Impact**: Demonstrates realistic document chaos that construction companies face daily

#### 2. Multiple Python Scripts (Modular Approach)
- **Decision**: Split into 3 separate scripts instead of one large file
- **Rationale**: 
  - Easier to maintain and modify
  - Each script handles logical grouping
  - Prevents single-file complexity
- **Files**: Part 1 (invoices 1-5), Part 2 (invoices 6-10 + permits), Part 3 (contracts + reports)

#### 3. Layout Diversity Strategy
- **Decision**: Each document type has unique formatting
- **Implementation**:
  - Bob's Hardware: Simple left-aligned (basic tradesperson)
  - ReadyMix Concrete: Professional colored header (large supplier)
  - Solid Foundations: Formal progress claim with centered header
  - Electrical Supplies: Detailed parts list (wholesale format)
  - Plumbing: Typewriter style (old-school plumber)
  - BuildRight Framers: Standard subcontractor claim
  - Timber Supplies: Clean centered header
  - Top Roof: Professional roofing contractor
  - Brickwork: Serif font (traditional tradesperson)
  - Paint Supplies: Compact wholesaler format
- **Rationale**: Real construction companies receive documents from dozens of sources, each with their own format
- **Impact**: Tests AI extraction across maximum format diversity

#### 4. Official Document Authenticity
- **Decision**: Permits and certificates use official government/regulatory formatting
- **Features**:
  - Colored headers for government documents
  - Proper numbering systems (BP-2024-xxxx, DA-xxxx, EC-xxxx)
  - Mandatory inspections listed
  - Test results tables for compliance certificates
  - Signatures and official seals noted
  - Legal language and conditions
- **Rationale**: Must demonstrate AI can extract from official documents too, not just invoices

#### 5. Contract Complexity Variation
- **Decision**: 3 different contract templates (3-page formal, 1-page simplified, 1-page basic)
- **Rationale**: Shows AI must handle legal documents of varying complexity
- **Features**:
  - Multi-page electrician contract with 10 sections
  - Single-page plumber contract (simplified)
  - Basic framer contract (typewriter style)

#### 6. Site Report Realism
- **Decision**: Include actual construction issues in reports
- **Details**:
  - Weather delays (8 days lost to rain)
  - Budget overrun ($8,500)
  - Schedule delays (12 days behind)
  - Client variations ($3,200 AC upgrade pending)
  - Safety incidents (none - positive note)
  - Inspection scheduling
  - Action items with responsibilities
- **Rationale**: Demonstrates platform's ability to extract project status from narrative documents

### Challenges Encountered

#### Challenge 1: Large Script Size
- **Problem**: Single script would be 2000+ lines
- **Solution**: Split into 3 modular scripts (Part 1, 2, 3)
- **Outcome**: More maintainable code structure

#### Challenge 2: Layout Diversity Requirement
- **Problem**: Need to create 20 different layouts without templates
- **Solution**: Used reportlab's low-level canvas API for maximum control
- **Techniques**:
  - Manual positioning with y_pos tracking
  - Different font combinations
  - Custom headers (boxed, colored, centered, left-aligned)
  - Table layouts vs free-form text
- **Outcome**: Each PDF truly unique in appearance

#### Challenge 3: Realistic Financial Data
- **Problem**: Invoice amounts must align with budget data
- **Solution**: Referenced project_budget_data.json to ensure consistency:
  - Bob's Hardware: $2,868.25 (timber frame materials)
  - ReadyMix Concrete: $7,872.26 (slab and footing pours)
  - Electrical: $28,540 contract matches budget
  - Plumbing: $19,150 contract matches budget
  - Framing: $46,500 matches budget
- **Outcome**: Cross-referenced data validates across documents

#### Challenge 4: Progress Claim Calculations
- **Problem**: Progress claims need realistic retention, previous claims, GST
- **Solution**: Implemented proper subcontractor claim math:
  - Total work this claim
  - Plus GST (10%)
  - Less previous claims
  - Less retention (5%)
  - Equals amount due
- **Example**: SF-PC-002: $19,500 work → $21,450 with GST → $10,377.50 after deductions

### Document Statistics

**Total Documents**: 20 PDFs
**Total File Size**: ~500KB combined
**Total Invoice Value**: ~$130,000
**Layout Variations**: 20 unique layouts

**By Category:**
- Invoices & Claims: 10 (50%)
- Official Documents: 5 (25%)
- Contracts: 3 (15%)
- Reports: 2 (10%)

**Font Families Used:**
- Helvetica (8 documents)
- Times Roman (4 documents)
- Courier (3 documents)
- Mixed (5 documents use multiple fonts)

**Page Counts:**
- Single-page: 15 documents
- Multi-page: 5 documents (contracts and detailed claims)

### Data Quality & Realism Features

#### 1. Inconsistent Formatting
- Phone numbers: "0412345678" vs "(02) 5555-1234"
- ABN: "12 345 678 901" vs "12345678901"
- Dates: Various formats
- Currency: $1,234.56 vs $1234.5

#### 2. Real Construction Issues Documented
- Weather delays costing days
- Budget overruns ($8,500)
- Client variations not invoiced
- Retention amounts held
- Insurance expiry risks
- Inspection scheduling challenges
- Payment delays

#### 3. Financial Tracking Gaps
- Retention calculated manually (error-prone)

  + backend/projects/project-d-101-riverside-plaza/data/ (empty template)
  + backend/projects/project-e-202-parkside-gardens/data/ (empty template)
  ```

### Technical Decisions
1. **Multi-Project Architecture Pattern**:
   - Each project has its own folder: `backend/projects/{project-id}/`
   - Project metadata stored in `project_info.json`
   - Data folders follow same structure: `data/01_LAND_PURCHASE/`, `data/12_BUDGET_TRACKING/`, etc.
   - Backend services instantiated per-request with project_id
   - Frontend uses localStorage for selected project persistence

2. **API Design**:
   - Query parameter approach: `/api/projects/dashboard?project_id=project-a-123-sunset-blvd`
   - Default project fallback for backward compatibility
   - Consistent pattern across all endpoints

3. **AI/ML Strategy**:
   - Phase 1: Enhanced document extraction (2-3 weeks)
   - Phase 2: PostgreSQL schema for extracted data (1-2 weeks)
   - Phase 3: ML models for classification (3-4 weeks)
   - Phase 4: Financial statement generator (2-3 weeks)
   - Phase 5: NL interface with GPT-4 (2-3 weeks)
   - Phase 6: Advanced predictive analytics (ongoing)

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Challenge**: TypeScript error `api.get()` doesn't exist
   - **Solution**: Created `getProjectsList()` function in api.ts

2. **Challenge**: Budget Breakdown showing "No data available"
   - **Solution**: Added projectId prop to BudgetTreemap component

3. **Challenge**: Document viewer only showing images
   - **Solution**: Added console logging, fixed download URL, investigating preview logic

4. **Challenge**: Massive architectural change from single to multi-project
   - **Solution**: Systematic refactor - services first, then routers, then frontend

### Performance & Quality Metrics
- **Build Status**: ✅ Passing (Vercel deployment successful)
- **Backend**: ✅ Running (Python FastAPI on port 8000)
- **Frontend**: ✅ Running (Vite dev server on port 5173)
- **Tests**: N/A (no automated tests yet)
- **Code Quality**: Clean, documented, following established patterns
