## 2025-10-01 - Session 1: Project Initialization

### What Was Completed
- ✅ Created project workflow documentation system:
  - `00_CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Master quick reference guide
  - `01_INITIAL_SETUP.md` - Detailed project initialization instructions
  - `02_CHECKPOINT.md` - Checkpoint and save progress workflow
  - `03_RESUME_SESSION.md` - Resume development session workflow
- ✅ Created project directory structure:
  - `wiki/` directory for documentation
  - `dummy_data/` directories for sample data organization
  - `backend/` placeholder for future Python FastAPI backend
- ✅ Created comprehensive wiki documentation:
  - `wiki/00_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Project vision, goals, and roadmap
  - `wiki/01_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture and tech stack
  - `wiki/02_DATA_STRUCTURE.md` - Data models and schemas
  - `wiki/03_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` - This file
  - `wiki/04_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - API documentation (planned)

### Current Project State

  - Documentation framework is complete
  - Directory structure established
  - Workflow system for session management in place

- **What's in progress**:
  - Frontend React + TypeScript + Vite setup (next task)
  - README.md creation (pending)
  - Vercel configuration (pending)
  - Git initialization and first commit (pending)

- **What's tested**:
  - N/A (no code written yet)

- **What needs testing**:
  - Frontend setup will need testing once created

### Code Changes Summary
- **Files created**:
  - `00_CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Quick reference for Claude Code workflow
  - `01_INITIAL_SETUP.md` - Initial project setup instructions
  - `02_CHECKPOINT.md` - Checkpoint workflow instructions
  - `03_RESUME_SESSION.md` - Resume session workflow instructions
  - `wiki/00_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Project overview and vision
  - `wiki/01_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture documentation
  - `wiki/02_DATA_STRUCTURE.md` - Data models and database schemas
  - `wiki/03_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` - This development log

- **Directories created**:
  - `wiki/`
  - `backend/`
  - `dummy_data/01_LAND_PURCHASE/`
  - `dummy_data/06_PURCHASE_ORDERS_INVOICES/`
  - `dummy_data/07_SUBCONTRACTORS/`
  - `dummy_data/11_CLIENT_BILLING/`
  - `dummy_data/12_BUDGET_TRACKING/`

### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None yet (frontend dependencies will be added next)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Documentation-First Approach**:
   - Decision: Create comprehensive documentation before coding
   - Why: Ensures clear vision and reduces rework
   - Alternative considered: Start coding immediately and document later

2. **Session Management Workflow**:
   - Decision: Use three separate workflow files (Start, Checkpoint, Resume)
   - Why: Provides clear, focused instructions for each phase
   - Master file (00_CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md) ties everything together

3. **Wiki-Based Documentation**:
   - Decision: Use markdown files in wiki/ directory
   - Why: Easy to version control, searchable, and developer-friendly
   - Alternative considered: External documentation (Notion, Confluence)

4. **GitHub as Single Source of Truth**:
   - Decision: Rely on Git commits and documentation for context
   - Why: Enables seamless resumption across sessions and AI context windows
   - Critical for long-term project memory

### Challenges Encountered
- None yet (documentation phase only)

### Next Session Goals
1. Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
2. Install and configure dependencies:
   - TailwindCSS
   - React Router
   - Recharts
   - Lucide-react
   - Axios
   - date-fns
3. Create comprehensive README.md
4. Create Vercel deployment configuration
5. Initialize Git repository and create .gitignore
6. Make first commits to GitHub with proper commit messages
7. Verify `npm run dev` works and displays welcome page

## 2025-10-01 - Session 2: Phase 1 - Core Dashboard UI

### What Was Completed
- ✅ Created reusable KPICard component (`src/components/dashboard/KPICard.tsx`):
  - Configurable icon, title, value, and subtitle
  - Support for positive/negative/neutral trends with color coding
  - Optional progress bar display
  - Responsive and accessible design
- ✅ Created Dashboard page (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`):
  - Professional header with project name display
  - Grid layout for 6 KPI cards showing:
    - Total Project Value: $650,000
    - Total Costs to Date: $574,600
    - Forecast Final Cost: $658,500
    - Projected Profit: -$8,500 (RED - over budget alert)
    - Project Completion: 65% (with progress bar)
    - Schedule Status: 12 days behind (RED alert)
  - Alert banner for over-budget and behind-schedule warnings
  - Financial summary section with budget breakdown
  - Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Created Home landing page (`src/pages/Home.tsx`):
  - Updated welcome page with navigation to dashboard
  - Feature cards highlighting key capabilities
  - Call-to-action button to view dashboard
  - Links to GitHub and Vercel
- ✅ Set up React Router for navigation:
  - Updated `App.tsx` with BrowserRouter
  - Routes: `/` (Home) and `/dashboard` (Dashboard)
  - Seamless client-side routing

### Current Project State
- **What's working**:
  - Complete React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
  - React Router navigation between Home and Dashboard
  - KPICard component fully functional and reusable
  - Dashboard displaying realistic project financial data
  - Responsive design works on all screen sizes
  - Alert system for over-budget and behind-schedule projects
  - Dev server runs without errors

- **What's in progress**:
  - N/A (Phase 1 complete)

- **What's tested**:
  - Dashboard page with all 6 KPI cards
  - Navigation between Home and Dashboard
  - Responsive layout on different screen sizes
  - Color-coded alerts for negative metrics
  - Progress bar functionality

- **What needs testing**:
  - Multiple project data (currently hardcoded for Project A)
  - Chart components (Phase 2)

### Code Changes Summary
- **Files created**:
  - `src/components/dashboard/KPICard.tsx` - Reusable KPI card component with trend indicators
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Executive dashboard with 6 KPI cards and financial summary
  - `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Landing page with navigation to dashboard

- **Files modified**:
  - `src/App.tsx` - Added React Router with routes for Home and Dashboard

- **Directories created**:
  - `src/components/dashboard/` - Dashboard-specific components
  - `src/pages/` - Page-level components

### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None (React Router was already installed in Phase 0)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Decision: Create reusable KPICard component instead of inline cards
   - Why: Promotes code reuse, easier to maintain, consistent UI
   - Alternative considered: Hardcoding each card separately

2. **Color-Coded Alerts**:
   - Decision: Use red for negative metrics (over budget, behind schedule)
   - Why: Immediate visual feedback for problem areas
   - Implementation: Trend prop ('positive', 'negative', 'neutral') controls colors

3. **Realistic Demo Data**:
   - Decision: Hardcode Project A data directly in Dashboard component
   - Why: Simple for Phase 1 demo, will refactor to JSON/API in Phase 3
   - Data shows realistic over-budget scenario (-$8,500 loss, 12 days behind)

4. **Alert Banner**:
   - Decision: Show prominent alert banner when project has issues
   - Why: Ensures critical information is immediately visible
   - Alternative considered: Just using red colors on cards (less noticeable)

5. **Client-Side Routing**:
   - Decision: Use React Router for SPA navigation
   - Why: Better UX, faster page transitions, maintains state
   - Alternative considered: Traditional multi-page app (worse UX)

### Challenges Encountered
- None - Phase 1 development went smoothly

### Next Session Goals
1. **Phase 2: Data Visualization**
   - Add revenue vs. expenses line chart (time series)
   - Add budget vs. actual bar chart (by category)
   - Add expense category breakdown pie chart
   - Implement date range filters
   - Make charts interactive with tooltips

2. **Phase 3 Preparation**:
   - Create JSON files with realistic financial data
   - Design data structure for transactions, budgets, invoices
