# Development Log

> **Purpose**: This file tracks the chronological development history of the intelligent-finance-platform project. Every session should add a new entry documenting what was completed, decisions made, challenges encountered, and next steps.

## 2025-10-01 - Session 1: Project Initialization

### What Was Completed
- ✅ Created project workflow documentation system:
  - `00_CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Master quick reference guide
  - `01_INITIAL_SETUP.md` - Detailed project initialization instructions
  - `02_CHECKPOINT.md` - Checkpoint and save progress workflow
  - `03_RESUME_SESSION.md` - Resume development session workflow
- ✅ Created project directory structure:
  - `wiki/` directory for documentation
  - `dummy_data/` directories for sample data organization
  - `backend/` placeholder for future Python FastAPI backend
- ✅ Created comprehensive wiki documentation:
  - `wiki/00_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Project vision, goals, and roadmap
  - `wiki/01_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture and tech stack
  - `wiki/02_DATA_STRUCTURE.md` - Data models and schemas
  - `wiki/03_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` - This file
  - `wiki/04_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - API documentation (planned)

### Current Project State
- **What's working**:
  - Documentation framework is complete
  - Directory structure established
  - Workflow system for session management in place

- **What's in progress**:
  - Frontend React + TypeScript + Vite setup (next task)
  - README.md creation (pending)
  - Vercel configuration (pending)
  - Git initialization and first commit (pending)

- **What's tested**:
  - N/A (no code written yet)

- **What needs testing**:
  - Frontend setup will need testing once created

### Code Changes Summary
- **Files created**:
  - `00_CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Quick reference for Claude Code workflow
  - `01_INITIAL_SETUP.md` - Initial project setup instructions
  - `02_CHECKPOINT.md` - Checkpoint workflow instructions
  - `03_RESUME_SESSION.md` - Resume session workflow instructions
  - `wiki/00_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Project overview and vision
  - `wiki/01_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture documentation
  - `wiki/02_DATA_STRUCTURE.md` - Data models and database schemas
  - `wiki/03_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` - This development log

- **Directories created**:
  - `wiki/`
  - `backend/`
  - `dummy_data/01_LAND_PURCHASE/`
  - `dummy_data/06_PURCHASE_ORDERS_INVOICES/`
  - `dummy_data/07_SUBCONTRACTORS/`
  - `dummy_data/11_CLIENT_BILLING/`
  - `dummy_data/12_BUDGET_TRACKING/`

### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None yet (frontend dependencies will be added next)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Documentation-First Approach**:
   - Decision: Create comprehensive documentation before coding
   - Why: Ensures clear vision and reduces rework
   - Alternative considered: Start coding immediately and document later

2. **Session Management Workflow**:
   - Decision: Use three separate workflow files (Start, Checkpoint, Resume)
   - Why: Provides clear, focused instructions for each phase
   - Master file (00_CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md) ties everything together

3. **Wiki-Based Documentation**:
   - Decision: Use markdown files in wiki/ directory
   - Why: Easy to version control, searchable, and developer-friendly
   - Alternative considered: External documentation (Notion, Confluence)

4. **GitHub as Single Source of Truth**:
   - Decision: Rely on Git commits and documentation for context
   - Why: Enables seamless resumption across sessions and AI context windows
   - Critical for long-term project memory

### Challenges Encountered
- None yet (documentation phase only)

### Next Session Goals
1. Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
2. Install and configure dependencies:
   - TailwindCSS
   - React Router
   - Recharts
   - Lucide-react
   - Axios
   - date-fns
3. Create comprehensive README.md
4. Create Vercel deployment configuration
5. Initialize Git repository and create .gitignore
6. Make first commits to GitHub with proper commit messages
7. Verify `npm run dev` works and displays welcome page
