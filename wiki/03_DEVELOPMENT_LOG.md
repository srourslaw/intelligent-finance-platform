### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None yet (frontend dependencies will be added next)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Documentation-First Approach**:
   - Decision: Create comprehensive documentation before coding
   - Why: Ensures clear vision and reduces rework
   - Alternative considered: Start coding immediately and document later

2. **Session Management Workflow**:
   - Decision: Use three separate workflow files (Start, Checkpoint, Resume)
   - Why: Provides clear, focused instructions for each phase
   - Master file (00_CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md) ties everything together

3. **Wiki-Based Documentation**:
   - Decision: Use markdown files in wiki/ directory
   - Why: Easy to version control, searchable, and developer-friendly
   - Alternative considered: External documentation (Notion, Confluence)

4. **GitHub as Single Source of Truth**:
   - Decision: Rely on Git commits and documentation for context
   - Why: Enables seamless resumption across sessions and AI context windows
   - Critical for long-term project memory

### Challenges Encountered

  - Feature cards highlighting key capabilities
  - Call-to-action button to view dashboard
  - Links to GitHub and Vercel
- ✅ Set up React Router for navigation:
  - Updated `App.tsx` with BrowserRouter
  - Routes: `/` (Home) and `/dashboard` (Dashboard)
  - Seamless client-side routing

### Current Project State
- **What's working**:
  - Complete React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
  - React Router navigation between Home and Dashboard
  - KPICard component fully functional and reusable
  - Dashboard displaying realistic project financial data
  - Responsive design works on all screen sizes
  - Alert system for over-budget and behind-schedule projects
  - Dev server runs without errors

- **What's in progress**:
  - N/A (Phase 1 complete)

- **What's tested**:
  - Dashboard page with all 6 KPI cards
  - Navigation between Home and Dashboard
  - Responsive layout on different screen sizes
  - Color-coded alerts for negative metrics
  - Progress bar functionality

- **What needs testing**:
  - Multiple project data (currently hardcoded for Project A)
  - Chart components (Phase 2)

### Code Changes Summary
- **Files created**:
  - `src/components/dashboard/KPICard.tsx` - Reusable KPI card component with trend indicators
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Executive dashboard with 6 KPI cards and financial summary
  - `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Landing page with navigation to dashboard

- **Files modified**:
  - `src/App.tsx` - Added React Router with routes for Home and Dashboard

- **Directories created**:
  - `src/components/dashboard/` - Dashboard-specific components
  - `src/pages/` - Page-level components

### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None (React Router was already installed in Phase 0)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Decision: Create reusable KPICard component instead of inline cards
   - Why: Promotes code reuse, easier to maintain, consistent UI
   - Alternative considered: Hardcoding each card separately

2. **Color-Coded Alerts**:
   - Decision: Use red for negative metrics (over budget, behind schedule)
   - Why: Immediate visual feedback for problem areas
   - Implementation: Trend prop ('positive', 'negative', 'neutral') controls colors

3. **Realistic Demo Data**:
   - Decision: Hardcode Project A data directly in Dashboard component
   - Why: Simple for Phase 1 demo, will refactor to JSON/API in Phase 3
   - Data shows realistic over-budget scenario (-$8,500 loss, 12 days behind)

4. **Alert Banner**:
   - Decision: Show prominent alert banner when project has issues
   - Why: Ensures critical information is immediately visible
   - Alternative considered: Just using red colors on cards (less noticeable)

5. **Client-Side Routing**:
   - Decision: Use React Router for SPA navigation
   - Why: Better UX, faster page transitions, maintains state
   - Alternative considered: Traditional multi-page app (worse UX)

### Challenges Encountered
- None - Phase 1 development went smoothly

### Next Session Goals
1. **Phase 2: Data Visualization**
   - Add revenue vs. expenses line chart (time series)
   - Add budget vs. actual bar chart (by category)
   - Add expense category breakdown pie chart
   - Implement date range filters
   - Make charts interactive with tooltips

2. **Phase 3 Preparation**:
   - Create JSON files with realistic financial data
   - Design data structure for transactions, budgets, invoices

### Technical Decisions Made

#### 1. PDF Format Only (No Excel/JSON)
- **Decision**: Generate actual PDF files only
- **Rationale**: User specified "PDF FORMAT ONLY - no JSON files" to match real-world construction document reality
- **Impact**: Demonstrates realistic document chaos that construction companies face daily

#### 2. Multiple Python Scripts (Modular Approach)
- **Decision**: Split into 3 separate scripts instead of one large file
- **Rationale**: 
  - Easier to maintain and modify
  - Each script handles logical grouping
  - Prevents single-file complexity
- **Files**: Part 1 (invoices 1-5), Part 2 (invoices 6-10 + permits), Part 3 (contracts + reports)

#### 3. Layout Diversity Strategy
- **Decision**: Each document type has unique formatting
- **Implementation**:
  - Bob's Hardware: Simple left-aligned (basic tradesperson)
  - ReadyMix Concrete: Professional colored header (large supplier)
  - Solid Foundations: Formal progress claim with centered header
  - Electrical Supplies: Detailed parts list (wholesale format)
  - Plumbing: Typewriter style (old-school plumber)
  - BuildRight Framers: Standard subcontractor claim
  - Timber Supplies: Clean centered header
  - Top Roof: Professional roofing contractor
  - Brickwork: Serif font (traditional tradesperson)
  - Paint Supplies: Compact wholesaler format
- **Rationale**: Real construction companies receive documents from dozens of sources, each with their own format
- **Impact**: Tests AI extraction across maximum format diversity

#### 4. Official Document Authenticity
- **Decision**: Permits and certificates use official government/regulatory formatting
- **Features**:
  - Colored headers for government documents
  - Proper numbering systems (BP-2024-xxxx, DA-xxxx, EC-xxxx)
  - Mandatory inspections listed
  - Test results tables for compliance certificates
  - Signatures and official seals noted
  - Legal language and conditions
- **Rationale**: Must demonstrate AI can extract from official documents too, not just invoices

#### 5. Contract Complexity Variation
- **Decision**: 3 different contract templates (3-page formal, 1-page simplified, 1-page basic)
- **Rationale**: Shows AI must handle legal documents of varying complexity
- **Features**:
  - Multi-page electrician contract with 10 sections
  - Single-page plumber contract (simplified)
  - Basic framer contract (typewriter style)

#### 6. Site Report Realism
- **Decision**: Include actual construction issues in reports
- **Details**:
  - Weather delays (8 days lost to rain)
  - Budget overrun ($8,500)
  - Schedule delays (12 days behind)
  - Client variations ($3,200 AC upgrade pending)
  - Safety incidents (none - positive note)
  - Inspection scheduling
  - Action items with responsibilities
- **Rationale**: Demonstrates platform's ability to extract project status from narrative documents

### Challenges Encountered

#### Challenge 1: Large Script Size
- **Problem**: Single script would be 2000+ lines
- **Solution**: Split into 3 modular scripts (Part 1, 2, 3)
- **Outcome**: More maintainable code structure

#### Challenge 2: Layout Diversity Requirement
- **Problem**: Need to create 20 different layouts without templates
- **Solution**: Used reportlab's low-level canvas API for maximum control
- **Techniques**:
  - Manual positioning with y_pos tracking
  - Different font combinations
  - Custom headers (boxed, colored, centered, left-aligned)
  - Table layouts vs free-form text
- **Outcome**: Each PDF truly unique in appearance

#### Challenge 3: Realistic Financial Data
- **Problem**: Invoice amounts must align with budget data
- **Solution**: Referenced project_budget_data.json to ensure consistency:
  - Bob's Hardware: $2,868.25 (timber frame materials)
  - ReadyMix Concrete: $7,872.26 (slab and footing pours)
  - Electrical: $28,540 contract matches budget
  - Plumbing: $19,150 contract matches budget
  - Framing: $46,500 matches budget
- **Outcome**: Cross-referenced data validates across documents

#### Challenge 4: Progress Claim Calculations
- **Problem**: Progress claims need realistic retention, previous claims, GST
- **Solution**: Implemented proper subcontractor claim math:
  - Total work this claim
  - Plus GST (10%)
  - Less previous claims
  - Less retention (5%)
  - Equals amount due
- **Example**: SF-PC-002: $19,500 work → $21,450 with GST → $10,377.50 after deductions

### Document Statistics

**Total Documents**: 20 PDFs
**Total File Size**: ~500KB combined
**Total Invoice Value**: ~$130,000
**Layout Variations**: 20 unique layouts

**By Category:**
- Invoices & Claims: 10 (50%)
- Official Documents: 5 (25%)
- Contracts: 3 (15%)
- Reports: 2 (10%)

**Font Families Used:**
- Helvetica (8 documents)
- Times Roman (4 documents)
- Courier (3 documents)
- Mixed (5 documents use multiple fonts)

**Page Counts:**
- Single-page: 15 documents
- Multi-page: 5 documents (contracts and detailed claims)

### Data Quality & Realism Features

#### 1. Inconsistent Formatting
- Phone numbers: "0412345678" vs "(02) 5555-1234"
- ABN: "12 345 678 901" vs "12345678901"
- Dates: Various formats
- Currency: $1,234.56 vs $1234.5

#### 2. Real Construction Issues Documented
- Weather delays costing days
- Budget overruns ($8,500)
- Client variations not invoiced
- Retention amounts held
- Insurance expiry risks
- Inspection scheduling challenges
- Payment delays

#### 3. Financial Tracking Gaps
- Retention calculated manually (error-prone)
- Previous claims tracked inconsistently
- Variation approvals verbal, not documented
- Missing PO numbers on some invoices

#### 4. Official Compliance
- Building Permit with 6 mandatory inspections
- Development Approval with 7 conditions
- Electrical testing (4 tests with results)
- Plumbing pressure tests (3 tests)
- Occupancy Certificate checklist

- ⚠️ Missing integration with existing dashboard
- ⚠️ Render deployment constraints not addressed (ephemeral filesystem)
- ⚠️ No clear MVP definition
- ⚠️ Cost estimation missing for LLM API calls
- ⚠️ File monitoring approach incompatible with Render

#### 2. Created Sanitized Implementation Plan
**Document**: `wiki/05_FINANCIAL_ETL_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`

**Restructured to 3 Pragmatic Phases**:

**Phase 1: MVP - Single File Processing (2 weeks)**
- JSON schema design with Pydantic models
- Excel extractor (pandas/openpyxl)
- Simple file upload endpoint
- Claude API integration for AI classification
- React upload UI component
- Display extracted JSON with confidence scores

**Phase 2: Batch Processing & Aggregation (2 weeks)**
- Multiple file uploads
- PDF extractor (pdfplumber + OCR)
- CSV extractor
- Aggregation engine (combine JSONs, resolve conflicts)
- Validation system (balance sheet validation, data quality checks)
- Enhanced dashboard with drill-down capabilities

**Phase 3: Automation & Production (2 weeks)**
- Webhook/trigger system (alternative to file monitoring)
- Email forwarding integration
- Conflict resolution UI
- Export templates (Excel, PDF, CSV)
- Complete audit trail system
- Error handling and recovery
- Production deployment

**Total Timeline**: 6 weeks (vs. 11+ weeks in original plan)

#### 3. Key Technical Decisions Documented

**Storage Strategy**:
- Phase 1: File-based JSON in `backend/data/projects/{project_id}/extractions/`
- Rationale: Simple, version-controllable, works on Render
- Migration path: PostgreSQL if scaling beyond 1000s of files

**AI Classification Approach**:
- Hybrid system: Rule-based for obvious items + LLM for ambiguous
- Phase 1: Use Claude API for all items (prove concept)
- Phase 2: Optimize with rules to reduce costs 70%
- Cost: $0.01-0.05 per file → optimized to $0.001-0.01 per file

**File Monitoring Solution**:
- Problem: Render ephemeral containers can't watch folders
- Phase 1: Manual upload via dashboard
- Phase 2: Email forwarding + Cloud storage webhooks (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Phase 3: API triggers via Zapier/Make.com

**JSON Schema Structure**:
```json
{
  "metadata": {...},
  "extracted_data": {
    "balance_sheet": {...},
    "income_statement": {...},
    "cash_flow": {...},
    "transactions": [...]
  },
  "validation": {...},
  "classification_stats": {...}
}
```

#### 4. Scope Control (What We're NOT Building)

Explicitly excluded to prevent scope creep:
- ❌ Multi-tenant support
- ❌ White-label customization
- ❌ ML model training/retraining loops
- ❌ QuickBooks/Xero integrations
- ❌ Real-time file monitoring
- ❌ Slack/Teams notifications
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ Advanced reporting engine

**Maybe later (Phase 4+)**: Cloud storage monitoring, feedback loops, accounting software exports

#### 5. Cost Analysis

**Per File Costs**:
- Excel extraction: Free (pandas/openpyxl)
- PDF extraction: Free (pdfplumber) or $0.001 for OCR
- AI classification: $0.01-0.05 (Claude API)
- Storage: $0.0001
- **Total**: ~$0.01-0.05 per file

**Monthly Estimates**:
- 100 files/month: $1-5
- 1,000 files/month: $10-50
- 10,000 files/month: $100-500

**Optimization**: Hybrid approach reduces costs by 70%

#### 6. Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI classification inaccuracy | Show confidence scores, allow corrections, hybrid approach |
| File format variations | Start with common formats, robust parsers, graceful degradation |
| Render container restarts | Persistent storage, stateless design, idempotent operations |
| API cost overruns | Per-project budgets, rate limiting, caching, hybrid classification |
| Large file performance | Async processing, progress updates, timeout handling |

#### 7. Success Metrics Defined

**Phase 1**:
- ✅ 1 file uploaded and extracted successfully
- ✅ AI classification accuracy >90%
- ✅ Processing time <30 seconds
- ✅ JSON validates correctly

**Phase 2**:
- ✅ 20 files processed and aggregated
- ✅ Balance Sheet balances correctly
- ✅ 100% data lineage traceable
- ✅ Aggregation handles duplicates

**Phase 3**:
- ✅ 100+ files processed reliably
- ✅ <1% error rate
- ✅ Average processing <20 seconds
- ✅ Cost per file <$0.02
- ✅ User satisfaction >4/5

### Current Project State

**Unchanged** - No code modifications in this session. This was pure planning and documentation.

**Dashboard Features** (still working):
- 7-tab Financial Statements
- Enterprise Executive Dashboard
- C-Suite Analytics
- Document Viewer
- All deployed on Vercel + Render

### Code Changes Summary
**Files Created**: 1
- `wiki/05_FINANCIAL_ETL_SYSTEM_PLAN.md` (comprehensive 600+ line plan)

**Files Modified**: 2
- `wiki/CHECKPOINT_2025-10-03.md` (added ETL planning section)
- `wiki/03_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` (this entry)

**Code Changes**: None (planning phase only)

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Phased Approach**: 3 phases × 2 weeks = 6 weeks total
2. **MVP First**: Single file processing before batch
3. **Storage**: File-based JSON, not database (initially)
4. **AI**: Hybrid classification (rules + LLM)
5. **Monitoring**: Manual upload → Email/Cloud → API triggers
6. **Costs**: Budget $0.01-0.05 per file, optimize to $0.001-0.01

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Original plan too ambitious**: 16 prompts, 11+ weeks, over-engineered
2. **Render constraints**: Can't do traditional file monitoring
3. **Cost concerns**: Pure LLM approach too expensive at scale
4. **Scope creep risk**: Many "nice-to-have" features that aren't MVP

### Next Session Goals

**Ready to Begin Phase 1 Implementation**:

**Week 1**:
1. Design complete JSON schema with Pydantic models
2. Build Excel extractor (`backend/extraction/excel_extractor.py`)
3. Create file upload endpoint (`backend/routes/upload.py`)
4. Set up file storage structure

**Week 2**:
5. Integrate Claude API for classification (`backend/classification/ai_classifier.py`)
6. Build React upload UI component
7. Display extraction results with confidence scores
8. End-to-end testing with sample files

**Success Criteria**: Upload 1 Excel file → see extracted JSON → AI classifies correctly → view in dashboard
