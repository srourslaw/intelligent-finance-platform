### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None yet (frontend dependencies will be added next)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Documentation-First Approach**:
   - Decision: Create comprehensive documentation before coding
   - Why: Ensures clear vision and reduces rework
   - Alternative considered: Start coding immediately and document later

2. **Session Management Workflow**:
   - Decision: Use three separate workflow files (Start, Checkpoint, Resume)
   - Why: Provides clear, focused instructions for each phase
   - Master file (00_CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md) ties everything together

3. **Wiki-Based Documentation**:
   - Decision: Use markdown files in wiki/ directory
   - Why: Easy to version control, searchable, and developer-friendly
   - Alternative considered: External documentation (Notion, Confluence)

4. **GitHub as Single Source of Truth**:
   - Decision: Rely on Git commits and documentation for context
   - Why: Enables seamless resumption across sessions and AI context windows
   - Critical for long-term project memory

### Challenges Encountered
- None yet (documentation phase only)

### Next Session Goals
1. Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
2. Install and configure dependencies:
   - TailwindCSS
   - React Router
   - Recharts
   - Lucide-react
   - Axios
   - date-fns
3. Create comprehensive README.md
4. Create Vercel deployment configuration
5. Initialize Git repository and create .gitignore

  - Configurable icon, title, value, and subtitle
  - Support for positive/negative/neutral trends with color coding
  - Optional progress bar display
  - Responsive and accessible design
- ✅ Created Dashboard page (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`):
  - Professional header with project name display
  - Grid layout for 6 KPI cards showing:
    - Total Project Value: $650,000
    - Total Costs to Date: $574,600
    - Forecast Final Cost: $658,500
    - Projected Profit: -$8,500 (RED - over budget alert)
    - Project Completion: 65% (with progress bar)
    - Schedule Status: 12 days behind (RED alert)
  - Alert banner for over-budget and behind-schedule warnings
  - Financial summary section with budget breakdown

- ✅ Created Home landing page (`src/pages/Home.tsx`):
  - Updated welcome page with navigation to dashboard
  - Feature cards highlighting key capabilities
  - Call-to-action button to view dashboard
  - Links to GitHub and Vercel
- ✅ Set up React Router for navigation:
  - Updated `App.tsx` with BrowserRouter
  - Routes: `/` (Home) and `/dashboard` (Dashboard)
  - Seamless client-side routing

### Current Project State
- **What's working**:
  - Complete React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
  - React Router navigation between Home and Dashboard
  - KPICard component fully functional and reusable
  - Dashboard displaying realistic project financial data
  - Responsive design works on all screen sizes
  - Alert system for over-budget and behind-schedule projects
  - Dev server runs without errors

- **What's in progress**:
  - N/A (Phase 1 complete)

- **What's tested**:
  - Dashboard page with all 6 KPI cards
  - Navigation between Home and Dashboard
  - Responsive layout on different screen sizes
  - Color-coded alerts for negative metrics
  - Progress bar functionality

- **What needs testing**:
  - Multiple project data (currently hardcoded for Project A)
  - Chart components (Phase 2)

### Code Changes Summary
- **Files created**:
  - `src/components/dashboard/KPICard.tsx` - Reusable KPI card component with trend indicators
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Executive dashboard with 6 KPI cards and financial summary
  - `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Landing page with navigation to dashboard

- **Files modified**:
  - `src/App.tsx` - Added React Router with routes for Home and Dashboard

- **Directories created**:
  - `src/components/dashboard/` - Dashboard-specific components
  - `src/pages/` - Page-level components

### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None (React Router was already installed in Phase 0)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Decision: Create reusable KPICard component instead of inline cards
   - Why: Promotes code reuse, easier to maintain, consistent UI
   - Alternative considered: Hardcoding each card separately

2. **Color-Coded Alerts**:
   - Decision: Use red for negative metrics (over budget, behind schedule)
   - Why: Immediate visual feedback for problem areas
   - Implementation: Trend prop ('positive', 'negative', 'neutral') controls colors

3. **Realistic Demo Data**:
   - Decision: Hardcode Project A data directly in Dashboard component
   - Why: Simple for Phase 1 demo, will refactor to JSON/API in Phase 3
   - Data shows realistic over-budget scenario (-$8,500 loss, 12 days behind)

4. **Alert Banner**:
   - Decision: Show prominent alert banner when project has issues
   - Why: Ensures critical information is immediately visible
   - Alternative considered: Just using red colors on cards (less noticeable)

5. **Client-Side Routing**:
   - Decision: Use React Router for SPA navigation
   - Why: Better UX, faster page transitions, maintains state
   - Alternative considered: Traditional multi-page app (worse UX)

### Challenges Encountered
- None - Phase 1 development went smoothly

### Next Session Goals
1. **Phase 2: Data Visualization**
   - Add revenue vs. expenses line chart (time series)
   - Add budget vs. actual bar chart (by category)
   - Add expense category breakdown pie chart
   - Implement date range filters
   - Make charts interactive with tooltips

2. **Phase 3 Preparation**:
   - Create JSON files with realistic financial data
   - Design data structure for transactions, budgets, invoices

  - 6 variations (demonstrating $6,460 revenue leakage from uninvoiced variations)
  - 8 defects with severity levels and status tracking
  - Data quality issues tracker with 15 identified problems

- ✅ Created `wiki/DUMMY_DATA_GUIDE.md` (comprehensive documentation):
  - Full project financial breakdown
  - Detailed explanation of all data structures
  - Critical issues highlighted (over budget, overdue payments, defects)
  - How AI would extract value from messy data
  - Platform value proposition demonstration
  - Usage guide for developers

- ✅ Created `dummy_data/README.md`:

  - `06_PURCHASE_ORDERS_INVOICES/README.md`
  - `07_SUBCONTRACTORS/README.md`
  - `11_CLIENT_BILLING/README.md`
  - `12_BUDGET_TRACKING/README.md`

- ✅ Created sample CSV file:
  - `MASTER_PROJECT_BUDGET_Sheet1_Budget_Summary.csv`

### Current Project State
- **What's working**:
  - Complete realistic dummy data for Project A
  - Comprehensive documentation of data structure
  - Ready for Phase 3 integration
  - Data demonstrates real construction company chaos

- **What's in progress**:
  - N/A (Dummy data creation complete)

- **What's tested**:
  - JSON structure validated
  - All financial calculations verified
  - Data relationships confirmed

- **What needs testing**:
  - Integration with frontend dashboard (Phase 3)
  - Data import/parsing functionality

### Code Changes Summary
- **Files created**:
  - `dummy_data/project_a_comprehensive_data.json` - 400+ lines of realistic project data
  - `wiki/DUMMY_DATA_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive 500+ line documentation
  - `dummy_data/README.md` - Main dummy data overview
  - `dummy_data/12_BUDGET_TRACKING/README.md` - Budget tracking explanation
  - `dummy_data/12_BUDGET_TRACKING/MASTER_PROJECT_BUDGET_Sheet1_Budget_Summary.csv` - Sample CSV
  - README files for all 5 dummy_data subdirectories

### Dependencies Added/Updated
- None (data files only)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **JSON Instead of Excel Files**:
   - Decision: Use structured JSON instead of actual .xlsx files
   - Why: Easier to parse programmatically, better for web app, version control friendly
   - Alternative considered: Real Excel files (harder to work with in browser)
   - Note: JSON represents data extracted from messy Excel - READMEs explain the "messiness"

2. **Single Comprehensive Data File**:
   - Decision: One main `project_a_comprehensive_data.json` with all data
   - Why: Easier to import, maintains relationships, shows full picture
   - Alternative considered: Separate JSON files per category (more scattered)

3. **Realistic Data with Issues**:
   - Decision: Intentionally include problems (overdue payments, missing invoices, budget overruns)
   - Why: Demonstrates platform's value in identifying and solving problems
   - Data shows: $6,460 revenue leakage, $130k overdue, $8,500 over budget, 12 days late

4. **Data Quality Issues Tracker**:
   - Decision: Include `dataQualityIssues` object with AI recommendations
   - Why: Shows what platform would automatically detect and recommend
   - Categories: Missing invoices, overdue payments, insurance expiry, critical defects, over budget items

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - Decision: Create detailed `DUMMY_DATA_GUIDE.md` explaining everything
   - Why: Helps developers understand data, demonstrates industry knowledge to clients
   - Content: 500+ lines explaining every aspect of the data

### Challenges Encountered
