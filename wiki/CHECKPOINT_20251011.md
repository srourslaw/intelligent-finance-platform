# Checkpoint: October 11, 2025 - Financial Builder Download Fix Session

## Quick Resume Instructions
To continue from this checkpoint:
1. Pull latest from GitHub: `git pull origin main`
2. Navigate to backend: `cd intelligent-finance-platform/backend`
3. Start backend: `python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
4. Navigate to frontend: `cd ../frontend`
5. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
6. Open browser: http://localhost:5173

## What Works Right Now
- ✅ **Financial Builder Pipeline**: Full 6-phase processing (extract → parse → deduplicate → categorize → generate Excel)
- ✅ **Dashboard Display**: Results shown with 4 colorful metric cards after pipeline completion
- ✅ **Excel Generation**: Successfully creates Financial_Model.xlsx with 5 sheets (Summary, Revenue, Direct Costs, Indirect Costs, Transactions)
- ✅ **Excel Cell Sanitization**: Removes illegal control characters that caused openpyxl errors
- ✅ **API Metadata**: Pipeline results properly stored in `job_metadata` column and returned via API
- ✅ **Download Endpoint**: Backend `/api/financial-builder/{project_id}/download` endpoint works via curl
- ✅ **Data Normalization Layer**: New models for normalized data points with lineage tracking

## What's In Progress
- 🔄 **Browser Download Functionality** - Status: Download endpoint works via curl with auth token, but browser download still fails
  - Frontend has authenticated fetch code with Bearer token
  - Backend resolves relative file paths correctly
  - Issue: Download still redirects to login in browser despite working in curl tests

## What's Next (Priority Order)
1. **Fix Browser Download** - Debug why authenticated fetch works for other endpoints but not download
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify token is being sent correctly
   - Test with Postman/Insomnia to isolate frontend vs backend issue
   - Consider alternative download approaches (pre-signed URLs, direct file serving)

2. **Test Complete Financial Builder Workflow**
   - Run full pipeline end-to-end
   - Verify all 123 files process successfully
   - Test with different project IDs
   - Validate Excel output quality

3. **Add Manual Review Interface**
   - UI for resolving conflicts in normalized data
   - Ability to merge duplicate transactions
   - Manual categorization override

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache parsed template dictionary
   - Batch database operations
   - Optimize PDF extraction (currently ~5-10 seconds per file)

## Critical Notes
- ⚠️ **Download Authentication Issue**: Backend endpoint verified working with curl + Bearer token, but browser download fails. Need to investigate browser-specific auth flow.
- ⚠️ **Database Migration Required**: If resuming on clean database, run: `sqlite3 backend/data/financial_builder.db "ALTER TABLE extraction_jobs ADD COLUMN job_metadata TEXT;"`
- ⚠️ **Excel Files Excluded**: Added `backend/data/projects/*/output/*.xlsx` to .gitignore to avoid committing generated Excel files
- ⚠️ **MinerU Dependency**: PDF extraction requires magic-pdf (MinerU) to be installed
- ⚠️ **Processing Time**: Full pipeline takes ~15-20 minutes for 123 files (mostly PDF extraction time)

## File Locations (Quick Reference)
- **Financial Builder Page**: `frontend/src/pages/FinancialBuilder.tsx`
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: `backend/app/routers/financial_builder.py`
- **Excel Generation**: `backend/app/services/excel_populator.py`
- **File Extraction**: `backend/app/services/file_extractor.py`
- **Data Models**: `backend/app/models/extraction.py`, `backend/app/models/data_points.py`
- **Normalization Layer**: `backend/app/services/transaction_parser.py`, `backend/app/services/data_point_mapper.py`
- **Database**: `backend/data/financial_builder.db`

## Debug Notes
- **Excel Error Fixed**: "Electrical Compliance Certificate (EC- cannot be used in worksheets" was caused by illegal control characters in PDF-extracted cell content, not worksheet names
- **Path Resolution Fixed**: Download endpoint now correctly resolves relative paths from database by making them absolute relative to backend directory
- **Metadata Storage Fixed**: Added `job_metadata` column to `extraction_jobs` table and updated all code to use it consistently
- **Frontend Download Code**: Uses authenticated fetch with localStorage token and creates blob download via temporary `<a>` element

## Session Summary
This session focused on fixing two critical issues with the Financial Builder:

1. **Dashboard Not Displaying Results**: Fixed by adding `job_metadata` column to database, updating API responses to include metadata, and ensuring frontend properly reads the metadata field.

2. **Excel Download Redirecting to Login**: Partially fixed by:
   - Adding authenticated download endpoint with Bearer token support
   - Implementing path resolution for relative file paths
   - Updating frontend to use fetch with Authorization header
   - **Still Issue**: Browser download continues to fail despite curl tests showing endpoint works correctly

The root cause analysis revealed the "Electrical Compliance Certificate" error was actually illegal control characters in cell content (not worksheet names), which was fixed by adding a `sanitize_cell_value()` function that removes ASCII control characters 0-31 (except tab, newline, CR).

## Environment Setup
- **Python**: 3.9+
- **Node**: v16+
- **Backend Port**: 8000
- **Frontend Port**: 5173
- **Database**: SQLite at `backend/data/financial_builder.db`
- **Key Python Packages**: fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, openpyxl, pandas, magic-pdf (MinerU)
- **Key npm Packages**: react, typescript, vite, tailwindcss, lucide-react

## Known Issues
1. **Download Button**: Works via curl but not in browser - needs authentication flow debugging
2. **Slow PDF Processing**: Each PDF takes 5-10 seconds to extract (MinerU processing time)
3. **Memory Usage**: Processing 123 files can consume significant memory during batch operations
