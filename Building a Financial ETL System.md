Your approach is fundamentally smarter than asking AI to analyze everything at once. Let me validate, expand, and architect this properly for you.

✅ Why Your Approach is Superior
❌ Traditional (Wrong) Approach:
Dump 1000s of files → Ask AI "analyze everything" → Get confused/incomplete results
Problems: Context limits, hallucinations, missed data, inconsistent extraction
✅ Your (Smart) Approach:
File-by-file extraction → Structured JSON → Incremental population → Live dashboard
Benefits: Scalable, accurate, traceable, incremental, and automated
You've essentially designed an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for financial data!

Incremental processing = scales infinitely
Automated monitoring = hands-off operation

This is exactly how professional data engineering teams would approach this problem!
Ready to start coding? I can help you build Phase 1 right now - the Excel extractor that outputs to JSON. Want me to create that code?RetryHSI have already developed the previous things we talked about using Claude Code max now I want to add these on top, so I want you to give the prompts needed to build this step by step, keep in mind currently I am using Github, built everything in react viewing hte dashboard in Vercel and Render for python, I want the plan not the codes as claude code max can do it via asking it with prompts so make the plan the introduction is clear of what we want to buildEdit🎯 Complete Prompt Plan for Claude Code Max
Introduction & Context Setting
Use this as your FIRST PROMPT to Claude Code Max to establish context:

PROMPT 1: Project Context & Vision
I'm building an AI-powered financial data extraction and consolidation system. Here's the current state and what I want to add:

## CURRENT SYSTEM (Already Built):
- Frontend: React dashboard hosted on Vercel
- Backend: Python APIs hosted on Render
- Repository: GitHub (provide repo structure if asked)
- Current Features: [describe what you have - basic dashboard, file uploads, etc.]

## WHAT I WANT TO BUILD NOW:
A sophisticated file-by-file extraction system that:

1. Monitors folders for financial documents (Excel, CSV, PDFs, images)
2. Extracts data from EACH file individually (not all at once)
3. Uses AI/ML to classify and map extracted line items to standard financial categories
4. Stores extracted data as structured JSON with full metadata and lineage
5. Aggregates all JSON files to populate a comprehensive financial template
6. Updates the live React dashboard automatically when new files are added

## THE ARCHITECTURE:
- File Monitor (Python) → watches specified folders
- Extractor Layer → processes one file at a time based on type
- AI Classifier → maps extracted items to standard categories
- JSON Storage → intermediate storage with metadata
- Aggregation Engine → combines all JSONs intelligently
- Template Populator → fills Excel financial model
- Dashboard API → feeds data to React frontend

## MY APPROACH (Key Innovation):
Instead of overwhelming AI with 1000s of files at once, I process ONE file at a time, extract to a standardized JSON schema, then aggregate. This is scalable, traceable, and accurate.

## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Python backend must deploy to Render
- React frontend must deploy to Vercel
- Need to handle: Excel, CSV, PDF, images (OCR), Word docs
- Budget considerations for API calls (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Need full audit trail (which file, which cell, what confidence level)

## DELIVERABLES I NEED:
1. JSON schema for extracted data (the "skeleton structure")
2. Python extraction modules (per file type)
3. AI/ML classification system
4. Aggregation logic with conflict resolution
5. API endpoints for React dashboard
6. File monitoring system
7. Deployment configurations for Render

Can you help me build this step-by-step? Let's start by reviewing my current project structure and then plan the implementation phases.

What information do you need from me about my current setup?

Phase-by-Phase Prompts
PROMPT 2: JSON Schema Design
Let's design the comprehensive JSON schema that will be the "skeleton structure" for all extracted financial data.

## REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must capture ALL possible financial statement line items from my master template:
   - Balance Sheet (Assets, Liabilities, Equity)
   - Income Statement (Revenue, COGS, OpEx, Other Income/Expense)
   - Cash Flow (Operating, Investing, Financing)
   - Transactions (individual line items)

2. Must include metadata:
   - Source file information (filename, path, hash)
   - Extraction timestamp
   - Confidence scores per field
   - Source cell/location references
   - Document classification
   - Time period information

3. Must support data lineage and audit trail

4. Must be flexible enough to handle:
   - Missing data (not all files have all fields)
   - Multiple currencies
   - Different date formats
   - Partial extractions

5. Should include data quality indicators:
   - Completeness score
   - Validation results
   - Balance checks
   - Duplicate detection

## OUTPUT NEEDED:
1. Complete JSON schema with nested structure
2. Example filled JSON for a sample file
3. Validation rules for the schema
4. Python Pydantic models for type safety

Please design this schema considering it will be used by:
- Extraction modules (write data)
- Aggregation engine (read and combine)
- Dashboard API (query and display)
- Audit reports (trace lineage)

Make it production-ready and well-documented.

PROMPT 3: File Classification System
Build a document classification system that identifies what type of financial document each file is BEFORE extraction.

## CURRENT CHALLENGE:
Files come with arbitrary names like "Q3_data_final_v2.xlsx" - we need to know if it's:
- Balance Sheet
- Income Statement / P&L
- Cash Flow Statement
- Transaction Log / General Ledger
- Invoice
- Receipt
- Bank Statement
- Payroll Report
- Tax Document
- Other

## REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must work with multiple file types: Excel, CSV, PDF, images
2. Should examine:
   - Filename patterns
   - Sheet names (for Excel)
   - Header row content
   - Column names
   - Data patterns
   - Keywords in text

3. Should return:
   - Document type (primary classification)
   - Confidence score
   - Sub-type if applicable
   - Suggested extraction template

4. Should handle:
   - Multi-sheet Excel files (different sheets = different types)
   - Combined documents (e.g., one PDF with multiple statement types)
   - Ambiguous documents (flag for manual review)

## IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:
Consider these approaches and recommend the best:
1. Rule-based classifier (keywords + patterns)
2. ML classifier (trained on examples)
3. LLM-based (Claude/GPT API)
4. Hybrid approach

## OUTPUT NEEDED:
1. file_classifier.py module
2. Classification configuration/rules file
3. Training data structure (if ML approach)
4. API endpoint for classification
5. Unit tests

Consider cost, accuracy, and speed tradeoffs. This runs on Render, so keep resource usage reasonable.

PROMPT 4: Excel/CSV Extractor
Build a robust Excel and CSV extraction module that processes one file at a time and outputs structured JSON.

## REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must handle messy real-world data:
   - Merged cells
   - Hidden rows/columns
   - Multiple sheets
   - Formulas (extract calculated values)
   - Empty rows/columns
   - Inconsistent formatting
   - Headers in different rows

2. Should intelligently detect:
   - Where the actual data starts (skip title rows)
   - Which columns are labels vs values
   - Multiple tables in one sheet
   - Currency symbols and formats
   - Date formats

3. Must extract:
   - All numerical data with context
   - Row and column headers
   - Sheet names
   - Cell references for audit trail
   - Comments/notes if present

4. Should handle:
   - Very large files (100k+ rows) efficiently
   - Password-protected files (with provided password)
   - Corrupted or partially readable files
   - Different Excel formats (.xlsx, .xls, .xlsm)

5. Must output to our JSON schema with:

3. Error handling and logging
4. Progress reporting for large files
5. API endpoint that accepts file upload
6. Unit tests with sample files

Make it production-ready for Render deployment. Consider memory usage.

PROMPT 5: AI/ML Line Item Classifier
Build an AI/ML system that takes extracted line items and maps them to our standardized financial categories.

## THE PROBLEM:
Different companies use different terminology:
- "Sales" vs "Revenue" vs "Turnover" vs "Income"
- "Office rent" vs "Rent expense" vs "Premises costs"
- "Salaries" vs "Wages" vs "Payroll" vs "Staff costs"

We need to map ALL variations to our standard categories.

## STANDARD CATEGORIES (from our master template):
Balance Sheet:
- assets.current.cash_on_hand
- assets.current.cash_in_bank_operating
- assets.current.accounts_receivable
- assets.non_current.land
- liabilities.current.accounts_payable
- equity.share_capital
[etc. - reference the full template]

Income Statement:
- revenue.product_sales
- revenue.service_revenue
- cogs.purchases
- operating_expenses.salaries_and_wages
- operating_expenses.rent
[etc.]

Cash Flow:
- operating.net_profit
- operating.depreciation
- investing.purchase_of_ppe
[etc.]

## REQUIREMENTS:
1. Must handle:
   - Exact matches ("Revenue" → revenue.product_sales)
   - Fuzzy matches ("Reveue" → revenue.product_sales)
   - Semantic matches ("Money from customers" → revenue)
   - Contextual matches (consider nearby cells)

2. Should support:
   - Multiple possible mappings with confidence scores
   - User-defined custom mappings (client-specific rules)
   - Learning from corrections (feedback loop)
   - Handling of unmapped items (flag for review)

3. Must be cost-effective:
   - If using LLM API, batch requests
   - Cache common mappings
   - Use local models for simple cases

4. Should return:
   - Primary category match
   - Confidence score (0-1)
   - Alternative suggestions
   - Reason for classification

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
Please recommend and implement ONE of these:

OPTION A: Hybrid (Recommended?)
- Rule-based for common items (free, fast)
- Fuzzy matching for typos
- LLM API for ambiguous items only
- Cost: mostly free, ~$0.001-0.01 per file

OPTION B: Sentence Transformers (ML)
- Use sentence-transformers for semantic similarity
- Pre-compute embeddings for all standard categories
- Compare extracted items to category embeddings
- Cost: free, but requires ML model hosting

OPTION C: Pure LLM (Most Accurate)
- Use Claude/GPT for all classifications
- Prompt engineering for financial context
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.05 per file

## OUTPUT NEEDED:
1. ai_classifier.py module
2. mapping_rules.json (for rule-based component)
3. category_embeddings.pkl (if ML approach)
4. Prompt templates (if LLM approach)
5. Feedback collection system
6. API endpoint
7. Cost estimation per file
8. Unit tests with tricky examples

Consider: This will process MANY files, so cost and speed matter. Recommend the best approach for my use case.

PROMPT 6: Data Validation System
Build a comprehensive data validation system that checks extracted and classified data for quality and correctness.

## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:

### 1. BALANCE SHEET VALIDATION:
- Assets = Liabilities + Equity (must balance)
- No negative assets (except contra-assets like allowances)
- Current assets + Non-current assets = Total assets
- All subtotals sum correctly

### 2. INCOME STATEMENT VALIDATION:
- Revenue - COGS = Gross Profit
- Gross Profit - OpEx = Operating Income
- All margin calculations are reasonable (0-100%)
- No impossible values (negative revenue, positive expenses)

### 3. CASH FLOW VALIDATION:
- Operating + Investing + Financing = Net Cash Change
- Ending cash = Beginning cash + Net change
- Cash from Balance Sheet matches Cash Flow statement

### 4. DATA QUALITY CHECKS:
- Date ranges are logical (start < end)
- Numbers are reasonable (no obvious data entry errors)
- Currency consistency
- No duplicate transactions
- Required fields are present
- Confidence scores meet threshold

### 5. CROSS-DOCUMENT VALIDATION:
- Net Profit from Income Statement = Starting point in Cash Flow
- Depreciation from Income Statement = Add-back in Cash Flow

PROMPT 7: Aggregation Engine
Build an aggregation engine that intelligently combines multiple extracted JSON files into a single consolidated financial model.

## THE CHALLENGE:
We have 10, 50, or 500 JSON files from different sources:
- Some are complete financial statements
- Some are transaction logs
- Some are invoices/receipts
- Some cover different time periods
- Some might have duplicate or conflicting data

## REQUIREMENTS:

### 1. SMART COMBINING:
- Identify which files cover which time periods
- Group by period (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Combine transaction-level data into statement-level
- Roll up detailed categories into summary categories

### 2. CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
When two files have different values for the same item:
- Check confidence scores (higher wins)
- Check recency (newer extraction wins?)
- Check completeness (more complete source wins)
- Flag for manual review if confidence is close
- Log all conflicts for audit

### 3. DUPLICATE DETECTION:
- Detect duplicate transactions (same date, amount, description)
- Detect duplicate files (same source data, different extractions)
- Handle legitimate duplicates vs errors
- User confirmation for ambiguous cases

### 4. PERIOD HANDLING:

- Calculate derived fields when possible
- Flag required but missing data

### 6. HIERARCHICAL AGGREGATION:
Example: Multiple invoices → Revenue by category → Total Revenue
- Transaction level → Category level → Statement level
- Maintain drill-down capability
- Keep source file lineage

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
The aggregated output should populate our financial template with:
- All periods filled
- All formulas working
- Full source lineage per cell
- Confidence scores maintained
- Validation status per item

## OUTPUT NEEDED:
1. aggregator.py module
2. Conflict resolution rules configuration
3. Period detection/grouping logic
4. Missing data handling strategies
5. API endpoint for aggregation
6. Progress tracking for large datasets
7. Aggregation report (what was combined, what conflicts)

- Maintain sheet links and references

### 2. FORMULA MANAGEMENT:
- Don't overwrite formula cells with static values
- Update formula ranges if periods change
- Ensure Balance Sheet balances
- Link Income Statement net profit to Cash Flow
- Link Cash Flow ending cash to Balance Sheet

### 3. FORMATTING PRESERVATION:
- Keep template styling (colors, fonts, borders)
- Apply number formatting (currency, percentages)
- Maintain column widths
- Keep conditional formatting rules

### 4. METADATA INCLUSION:
- Add a "Data Source" sheet with:
  - Which files contributed to which cells
  - Extraction dates
  - Confidence scores
  - Validation status
- Add cell comments with source file info
- Include timestamp of template generation

### 5. FLEXIBILITY:
- Handle templates with different structures
- Support custom templates per client
- Allow template versioning
- Support partial population (not all data available)

### 6. ERROR HANDLING:
- Detect template structure changes
- Handle missing template sections gracefully
- Validate populated template
- Generate error report if population fails

## SPECIAL FEATURES:

### Scenario Support:
- Generate multiple scenarios (best/base/worst case)
- Allow manual overrides
- Track which cells are auto-filled vs manual

### Version Control:
- Save populated templates with timestamp
- Keep history of generated templates
- Compare versions

## OUTPUT NEEDED:
