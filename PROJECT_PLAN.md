2. **Performance at scale**: Mitigation - Load testing, caching, database optimization, monitoring
3. **Data security**: Mitigation - Encryption, regular audits, penetration testing

### Business Risks
1. **Low adoption**: Mitigation - Beta testing, customer development, clear value proposition
2. **Competition**: Mitigation - AI differentiation, construction-specific features, excellent UX
3. **Pricing**: Mitigation - Market research, multiple tiers, value-based pricing
