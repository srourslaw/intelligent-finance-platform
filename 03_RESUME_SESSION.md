# Resume Development Session

## Context
**Repository:** https://github.com/srourslaw/intelligent-finance-platform
**Vercel:** https://vercel.com/hussein-srours-projects/intelligent-finance-platform

I'm returning to continue development on the Construction Financial Dashboard project. I need you to restore full context from the GitHub repository and prepare to continue where we left off.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Restore Project Context from GitHub
Please analyze the repository to understand the current state:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Review recent commit history
git log --oneline -10

# Check current branch
git branch -a

# Review project structure
ls -la
tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|dist|.git'
```

### 2. Read Critical Documentation
Review these files in order to restore context:

1. **README.md** - Project overview and current status
2. **wiki/03_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md** - Development history and progress
3. **wiki/CHECKPOINT_[LATEST].md** - Most recent checkpoint (if exists)
4. **PROJECT_PLAN.md** - Overall project roadmap (if exists)
5. **package.json** - Current dependencies and scripts
