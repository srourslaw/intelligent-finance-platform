# Checkpoint & Sync to GitHub

## Context
**Repository:** https://github.com/srourslaw/intelligent-finance-platform
**Vercel:** https://vercel.com/hussein-srours-projects/intelligent-finance-platform

I need to take a break from development. Before I stop, create a comprehensive checkpoint that documents everything we've done so I can resume seamlessly later.

## Your Tasks

### 1. Commit All Current Work
Review all modified, new, and deleted files:
```bash
git status
git add -A
```

Create a descriptive commit with:

Example format:
```
feat: [main feature completed]

- Added [specific components/features]
- Fixed [specific issues]
- Updated [specific files/documentation]
- Current status: [working/in-progress/needs-testing]

Next steps:
- [what needs to be done next]
```

Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Update Development Log
Update `wiki/03_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` with:

**Add a new dated entry with:**
```markdown

```

### 5. Verify Git Status
Confirm everything is committed and pushed:
```bash
git status  # Should show "working tree clean"
git log --oneline -5  # Show last 5 commits
```

### 6. Create Branch (Optional)
If we're in the middle of a feature, create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
git push origin feature/[feature-name]
```

Document branch name in the checkpoint file.

### 7. Test Current State
Before closing, verify the project still runs:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Document any issues or warnings in the checkpoint file.
