# Deployment Status - 2025-10-01

## 🔴 Current Issue: Dashboard Not Updating

### Root Cause
The dashboard on Vercel is **only showing the frontend** because:
1. ✅ **Frontend is deployed to Vercel** - Working correctly
2. ❌ **Backend is NOT deployed to Render yet** - Only running locally
3. ❌ **Frontend is pointing to `localhost:8000`** - Won't work in production

### Why Changes Aren't Reflected
- Vercel deploys successfully ✅
- GitHub is updated ✅
- **But the frontend can't connect to the backend** ❌
  - In production: Frontend tries to call `http://localhost:8000/api` (fails)
  - Locally: Works fine because backend is running on your machine

---

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. Created Render Configuration
- `render.yaml` - Automatic deployment configuration for Render
- `backend/.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete step-by-step deployment instructions

### 2. Pushed to GitHub
- Commit: `2bb3eba` - Render deployment configuration
- All files are ready for deployment

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Manual - Requires Your Action)

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **"New +"** → **"Blueprint"**
4. Select repository: `srourslaw/intelligent-finance-platform`
5. Render will detect `render.yaml` and auto-configure
6. Click **"Apply"** to deploy
7. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment
8. Copy the backend URL (e.g., `https://intelligent-finance-platform-backend.onrender.com`)

### Step 2: Configure Vercel Environment Variable
1. Go to Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/hussein-srours-projects/intelligent-finance-platform
2. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://intelligent-finance-platform-backend.onrender.com/api` (use your Render URL)
   - **Environments**: Check all (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Redeploy Frontend
1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"** → Confirm
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works
1. Visit: https://intelligent-finance-platform.vercel.app
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Try logging in (user: admin@test.com, password: admin123)
4. Check API requests go to Render backend
5. Verify dashboard loads project data

## 🎯 Expected Result After Deployment

Once both backend and frontend are properly deployed:
- ✅ Login will work
- ✅ Project selection will work
- ✅ Dashboard will show budget data
- ✅ Document viewer will list files
- ✅ All multi-project features functional

---

## 📊 Deployment Architecture

```
User Browser
     ↓
Vercel (Frontend - React)
     ↓ API calls via VITE_API_URL
Render (Backend - FastAPI)
     ↓ Reads from
Backend Projects Data (in repository)
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails on Render:
- Check build logs in Render dashboard
- Verify `backend/requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Check Python version is 3.11

### If frontend still can't connect:
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set in Vercel
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify Render backend health: `https://YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com/api/health`

### If CORS errors appear:
- Backend `main.py` already includes Vercel URLs in CORS
- If using custom domain, add it to `allow_origins` in `backend/app/main.py`

---

## 📁 Key Files

- `render.yaml` - Render deployment config
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI app with CORS
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment config
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Full deployment instructions

---

## 💰 Cost Estimate

Both services offer free tiers:
- **Vercel**: Free for hobby projects
- **Render**: Free tier (backend sleeps after 15min inactivity)

**Note**: Render free tier has 15-minute sleep timeout. First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds.
