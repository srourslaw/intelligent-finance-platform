# AI/ML Financial Intelligence Architecture

## Vision
Create an AI-powered system that reads messy, unstructured data from multiple sources (Excel files, PDFs, images) across all project folders and automatically generates comprehensive, accurate financial statements.

## Core Capabilities Needed

### 1. Document Intelligence Layer
**Purpose:** Extract and understand data from various file formats

**Technologies:**
- **OCR:** Tesseract/Google Vision API for scanned documents and images
- **PDF Parsing:** PyPDF2, pdfplumber for structured PDFs
- **Excel Parsing:** openpyxl, pandas for spreadsheets (already in use)
- **NLP:** spaCy or BERT for understanding context and relationships

**Input Sources:**
- Excel files (budget, timesheets, purchase orders, etc.)
- PDF invoices and contracts
- Site photos with embedded data
- Email attachments
- Handwritten notes (future)

### 2. Data Extraction & Normalization
**Purpose:** Convert messy data into structured, queryable format

**Key Features:**
- **Entity Recognition:** Identify costs, dates, vendor names, project phases
- **Relationship Mapping:** Connect invoices to purchase orders, payments to milestones
- **Data Validation:** Flag inconsistencies, missing data, duplicate entries
- **Currency Normalization:** Handle different formats ($1,000 vs 1000.00)
- **Date Standardization:** Parse various date formats

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Extracted Financial Transactions
CREATE TABLE extracted_transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id VARCHAR,
    source_file VARCHAR,
    source_type ENUM('invoice', 'po', 'timesheet', 'payment', 'variation'),
    transaction_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL,
    vendor VARCHAR,
    category VARCHAR,
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR,
    confidence_score FLOAT,
    extracted_at TIMESTAMP,
    verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Financial Statement Lines
CREATE TABLE financial_statement_lines (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id VARCHAR,
    statement_type ENUM('income', 'balance_sheet', 'cashflow', 'profit_loss'),
    line_item VARCHAR,
    amount DECIMAL,
    period DATE,
    source_transactions JSON,
    generated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 3. AI Financial Analyst Agent
**Purpose:** Understand financial relationships and generate statements

**Capabilities:**
- **Pattern Recognition:** Learn from existing data how transactions relate
- **Anomaly Detection:** Flag unusual expenses, missing payments, budget overruns
- **Predictive Analysis:** Forecast cash flow, project completion costs
- **Smart Categorization:** Auto-categorize expenses based on description
- **Cross-Project Insights:** Compare projects, identify trends

**ML Models:**
```python
# Model 1: Transaction Classifier
- Input: Transaction description, amount, vendor
- Output: Category (labor, materials, equipment, etc.)
- Model: Fine-tuned BERT or Random Forest

# Model 2: Anomaly Detector
- Input: Transaction features + historical patterns
- Output: Anomaly score + explanation
- Model: Isolation Forest or Autoencoder

# Model 3: Cash Flow Predictor
- Input: Historical spending patterns, project phase, remaining work
- Output: Weekly cash flow forecast
- Model: LSTM Time Series or XGBoost

# Model 4: Cost Overrun Predictor
- Input: Budget variance trends, project phase, defects count
- Output: Probability of cost overrun + estimated final cost
- Model: Gradient Boosting with feature engineering
```

### 4. Financial Statement Generator
**Purpose:** Automatically create professional financial reports

**Generated Statements:**

#### A. Income Statement (P&L)
```
Revenue:
  - Contract Value
  - Approved Variations
  - Milestone Payments Received

Costs:
  - Direct Labor
  - Materials & Supplies
  - Subcontractors
  - Equipment Rental
  - Site Overheads

Gross Profit
Operating Expenses
Net Profit
```

#### B. Cash Flow Statement
```
Cash Inflows:
  - Client Payments
  - Retention Releases

Cash Outflows:
  - Subcontractor Payments
  - Material Purchases
  - Labor Costs
  - Equipment

Net Cash Flow
Cash Position
```

#### C. Balance Sheet
```
Assets:
  - Accounts Receivable
  - Work in Progress
  - Materials on Hand

Liabilities:
  - Accounts Payable
  - Retention Held

Equity
```

#### D. Budget Variance Report
```
Category | Budget | Actual | Committed | Forecast | Variance | % Complete
---------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|----------|----------
[Auto-populated from all data sources]
```

### 5. Natural Language Interface
**Purpose:** Allow users to query financial data conversationally

**Examples:**
- "What's my total labor cost for Project A in September?"
- "Show me all unpaid invoices over $10,000"
- "Which subcontractors are behind on their work?"
- "Create a comparison report of all 5 projects"
- "What will Project C cost at completion?"
- "Flag any invoices that don't match purchase orders"

**Implementation:**
```python
# Use OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude API
# Convert natural language to SQL queries
# Execute and return results in human-readable format
```

### 6. Smart Dashboard Integration

**New Dashboard Sections:**

#### AI Insights Panel
```jsx
<AIInsightsPanel>
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è Project A: Labor costs trending 15% over budget"
  - "üí° Project B: Can save $12K by consolidating material orders"
  - "üìä Project C: On track to complete under budget"
  - "üî¥ Project D: Overdue payment detected - $45K from client"
</AIInsightsPanel>
```

#### Financial Statement Viewer
```jsx
<FinancialStatementViewer>
  <Tabs>
    <Tab name="Income Statement">
      {/* Auto-generated from all data sources */}
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Cash Flow">
      {/* Real-time cash position */}
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Balance Sheet">
      {/* Current financial position */}
    </Tab>
    <Tab name="Budget Variance">
      {/* Detailed variance analysis */}
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</FinancialStatementViewer>
```

#### AI Chat Assistant
```jsx
<AIChatAssistant>
  {/* ChatGPT-style interface */}
  {/* Ask questions about finances */}
  {/* Get instant answers with citations */}
</AIChatAssistant>
```
