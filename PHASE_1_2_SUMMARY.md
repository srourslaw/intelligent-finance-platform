## Features Delivered

### Phase 1: File Extraction & AI Classification
- ✅ Multi-format file upload (Excel, PDF, CSV, Images)
- ✅ Background processing with status tracking
- ✅ AI classification using Claude API (Hybrid: 70% rule-based, 30% LLM)
- ✅ Real-time polling for extraction status
- ✅ Transaction viewer with confidence scores
- ✅ File management (view, delete)
- ✅ Cost optimization: $0.001-0.01 per file

### Phase 2: Aggregation, Validation & Drill-down
- ✅ Multi-file aggregation with duplicate detection
- ✅ Conflict resolution (highest confidence wins)
- ✅ Transaction rollup into financial statements
- ✅ Balance Sheet equation validation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
- ✅ Income Statement validation (margins, negative revenue)
- ✅ Cash Flow validation
- ✅ Data completeness scoring
- ✅ Drill-down from totals to source files
- ✅ Professional expandable UI
- ✅ Source location tracking for audit trail

## Data Flow

```
User uploads file (Excel/PDF/CSV/Image)
  ↓
Backend extracts data using appropriate extractor
  ↓
Claude AI classifies transactions (hybrid rule-based + LLM)
  ↓
Saves ExtractionResult JSON to disk
  ↓
User triggers aggregation (multiple files)
  ↓
Aggregation Engine:
  - Loads all ExtractionResult JSONs
  - Removes duplicates using (date, description, amount) tuple
  - Resolves conflicts (keeps highest confidence)
  - Rolls up transactions into Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow
  ↓
Validator checks:
  - Assets = Liabilities + Equity (tolerance: $1.00)
  - Gross margin 0-100%
  - Data completeness
  ↓
Saves AggregatedFinancialData + ValidationResult to disk
  ↓
Frontend displays:
  - Consolidated financial statements
  - Validation errors/warnings
  - Drill-down to source files
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Hybrid AI Classification
- **Rule-based first** (70% of items - FREE): Matches keywords like "rent", "utilities", etc.
- **Claude API fallback** (30% of items - PAID): For ambiguous cases
- **Cost**: Reduced from $0.05/file to $0.001-0.01/file

### 2. File-Based JSON Storage
- **Storage**: `backend/data/extractions/` and `backend/data/aggregations/`
- **Format**: One JSON file per extraction/aggregation
- **Rationale**: Simple, version-controllable, works on Render ephemeral filesystem
- **Migration Path**: PostgreSQL if scaling beyond 1000s of files

### 3. Duplicate Detection
- **Strategy**: Group by (date, description, amount) tuple
- **Conflict Resolution**: Keep transaction with highest confidence
- **Use Case**: Handles copy-paste errors across multiple files

### 4. Validation Tolerance
- **Balance Sheet**: $1.00 tolerance for rounding errors
- **Severity Levels**:
  - **Error**: Balance difference > $1.00 (blocking issue)
  - **Warning**: Balance difference $0.01-$1.00 or negative margins
  - **Info**: Completeness scores, cash flow summaries

### 5. Drill-Down Implementation
- **Click any line item** → Shows source location (e.g., "Sheet1!B5")
- **Lists contributing files** → File metadata with original filenames
- **Audit trail**: Full traceability from aggregated total to source cell

## Testing the System

### Test Case 1: Single File Extraction
```bash
# 1. Upload Excel file via UI
# 2. Wait for "Completed" status
# 3. Click "View Results"
# Expected: See transactions with confidence scores, classification stats
```

### Test Case 2: Multi-File Aggregation
```bash
# 1. Upload 3 different Excel files with financial data
# 2. Use API or create aggregation via UI:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/aggregation/aggregate?project_id=Q1_2024" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# 3. View aggregation:
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/aggregation/result/Q1_2024" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Expected: Consolidated Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow
```

### Test Case 3: Validation
```bash
# Upload file with unbalanced balance sheet
# Expected: Validation errors showing exact difference
```

### Test Case 4: Drill-Down
```bash
# 1. Load aggregation in UI
# 2. Expand "Balance Sheet" section
# 3. Click any line item (e.g., "Cash")
# Expected: See source files and locations
```

## Known Limitations

1. **OCR Accuracy**: Depends on pytesseract quality for scanned documents
2. **PDF Tables**: Complex multi-page tables may need manual review
3. **No Transaction Editing**: Extracted data cannot be manually corrected yet
4. **No Conflict UI**: Duplicate resolution is automatic, no manual review
5. **File Size**: 50MB limit per file

## Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
ENVIRONMENT=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173
```

### Frontend (.env)
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
```

## Deployment

### Render (Backend)
```bash
# Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Start Command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

### Vercel (Frontend)
```bash
# Build Command: npm run build
# Output Directory: dist
# Install Command: npm install
```

## Cost Estimates

### Claude API Usage
- **Per file**: $0.001-0.01 (depends on transaction count and ambiguity)
- **100 files/month**: ~$1-10/month
- **1000 files/month**: ~$10-100/month

### Optimization Tips
1. Expand rule-based classification keywords (reduces LLM calls)
2. Cache common transaction patterns
3. Batch process files during off-peak hours

## Next Steps (Phase 3 - Future)

**Automation & Production Hardening**:
- [ ] Email integration for file uploads
- [ ] Scheduled batch processing
- [ ] Webhook support for Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Advanced conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Transaction editing interface
- [ ] Production deployment optimization

**Estimated Timeline**: 2 weeks
